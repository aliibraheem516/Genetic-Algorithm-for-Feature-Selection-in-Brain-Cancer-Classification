# Genetic Algorithm for Gene Selection in Brain Cancer Classification

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Genetic Algorithms** (GA) for **feature selection** in the classification of **brain cancer types** based on gene expression data. The dataset used in this project is the **Brain_GSE** dataset, which contains gene expression levels for different types of brain cancers, including ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, and normal samples.

The goal is to use a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant genes (features) and then build a **logistic regression model** to classify the cancer types based on the selected genes. The project showcases how genetic algorithms can be employed in bioinformatics and machine learning to optimize feature selection, improving model performance.

## Key Features

- **Genetic Algorithm (GA):** Used for selecting the best features (genes) from a large dataset. The GA simulates the process of natural selection, where only the best-performing features are retained and combined to form the next generation.
- **Logistic Regression:** After selecting the best features using the genetic algorithm, a logistic regression model is trained on these features to classify brain cancer types.
- **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the classification model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Genetic Algorithm Explanation

A **Genetic Algorithm** is a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection in biology. It works by simulating the process of evolution, where a population of candidate solutions (individuals) undergoes selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better solutions over time.

In this project, the GA is used to optimize feature selection. The **individuals** in the GA represent subsets of genes, and the **fitness** of each individual is evaluated based on how well its selected genes perform in the logistic regression model. The fittest individuals are then selected to form the next generation, which is iteratively refined until an optimal set of features is identified.

### Main Steps:
1. **Initialization:** Generate an initial population of randomly selected subsets of genes.
2. **Selection:** Evaluate the fitness of each individual (subset of genes) based on model performance.
3. **Crossover:** Combine pairs of selected individuals to create new individuals (subsets of genes).
4. **Mutation:** Randomly modify individuals to explore new feature subsets.
5. **Termination:** Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation steps until an optimal subset of genes is found.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Brain_GSE** dataset, available on Kaggle. This dataset contains gene expression data for multiple types of brain cancers. Each sample in the dataset represents the expression levels of thousands of genes, which are used as features for classification.

### Key Columns:
- **Samples:** The sample ID for each instance.
- **Type:** The cancer type or class label (e.g., 'ependymoma', 'glioblastoma').
- **Gene Expression Values:** A set of columns representing the expression levels of various genes.

## Results

- **Best Feature Selection:** The genetic algorithm selects the most relevant genes for the classification task.
- **Model Performance:** The logistic regression model trained on the selected features achieves high accuracy in classifying brain cancer types.

## Future Work

- **Feature Expansion:** Explore other machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques for feature selection.
- **Genetic Algorithm Enhancements:** Experiment with different genetic algorithm parameters (e.g., mutation rate, population size) to improve performance.
- **Cross-validation:** Implement cross-validation to better assess the robustness of the model.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of **Genetic Algorithms** in optimizing feature selection for complex biological datasets, enhancing the performance of machine learning models used in medical diagnostics.
